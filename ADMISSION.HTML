The school welcomes application from students, regardless of race, religion, colour, nation or ethnic origin or sex,
 whose principles and interests are in harmony with the ideals and traditions of the school as expressed in its policies, objectives and culture. 
Admission into the school, is however, a privileged, not a right, and may be withheld or withdrawn by the school at its discretion and in harmony with 
its mission and its purpose.</td><img src="DSC_0745.jpg"height=400 width=400>
